    <h2>Beyond Earth: A Journey Through Space</h2>
    <p>Space, the vast, seemingly endless expanse that surrounds our planet — has fascinated humankind for centuries.
        From early stargazers mapping constellations to modern scientists launching satellites and rovers, our curiosity
        about the universe has only grown. But what exactly is space? What secrets does it hold? And why is it so
        important to study it? This article aims to offer a simple yet meaningful journey through space, exploring what
        lies beyond Earth’s atmosphere and why it matters to us all.</p>

        <h2>The Infinite Mystery Above Us</h2>
        <p>Space, often called "outer space," is the region beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Unlike Earth, it has no air, no
            breathable oxygen, and almost no gravity. It begins around 100 kilometers (62 miles) above sea level, known
            as the Kármán line. Beyond this boundary, the sky turns black, and Earth’s blue fades into the darkness of
            the universe.</p>

        <p>Space is a frontier of mystery, beauty, and possibility. While we’ve uncovered much, we’ve only scratched the
            surface of the universe’s secrets. With every satellite launch and Mars mission, we inch closer to
            understanding where we came from — and where we might go next. Exploring space is not just about distant
            galaxies; it’s about discovering more about ourselves and our place in this magnificent universe.</p>
